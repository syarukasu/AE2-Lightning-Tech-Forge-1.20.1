# Overloaded Pattern Provider

<Row>
  <BlockImage id="ae2lt:overloaded_pattern_provider" scale="4" />
</Row>

The **Overloaded Pattern Provider** is the upgraded version of the vanilla <ItemLink id="ae2:pattern_provider" />, with **36 pattern slots** and a **wireless mode** for dispatching materials to remote machines across a distance.

## Core Features

* **36 pattern slots** (vanilla has 9)
* **Two operating modes**: Normal and Wireless
* **Overload Pattern support**: works with vanilla patterns, plus this mod's Overload Patterns
* **Auto return**: automatically pulls processed outputs back from remote machines
* **Import filter**: only allows results defined by the pattern back into the ME network

## Operating Modes

### Normal Mode

In Normal Mode, the Overloaded Pattern Provider pushes materials into **physically adjacent** machines, identical to the vanilla Pattern Provider. The main difference is the larger number of pattern slots.

### Wireless Mode

<ItemImage id="ae2lt:overloaded_wireless_connect_tool" scale="2" float="left" />

In Wireless Mode, the Overloaded Pattern Provider can dispatch materials to remote machines across a distance. Use the **Overloaded Wireless Connect Tool** to establish wireless connections:

1. Hold the Overloaded Wireless Connect Tool and **Shift + right-click** the Overloaded Pattern Provider to select it
2. Right-click a specific face of a target machine to connect
3. One provider can bind to multiple remote machines

Once connections are in place, the provider dispatches materials to the remote machines according to the selected distribution strategy.

### Distribution Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Round Robin | Dispatches to one remote machine at a time, in order |
| Balanced Distribution | Distributes materials evenly across all connected remote machines |

## Return Mode

The return mode determines how processed output is recovered from remote machines:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| OFF | No auto return |
| AUTO | Actively pulls output back from the remote machines |
| EJECT | Remote machines push output into the virtual output slot; the provider accepts it passively |

## Speed Tier

| Speed | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Normal | Standard cooldown (5 ~ 80 ticks) |
| Fast (Probe) | Adaptive cooldown; uses a probe mechanic to detect readiness early (1 ~ 40 ticks) |

## Import Filter

With "Filtered Import" enabled, the provider only accepts items listed as outputs on the current pattern when returning products — this prevents unrelated items from entering the network.

## Overload Pattern and Overload Pattern Encoder

  <ItemImage id="ae2lt:overload_pattern_encoder" scale="2" />
</Row>

The **Overload Pattern** is a specialty pattern, **only usable in the Overloaded Pattern Provider**. Use the **Overload Pattern Encoder** to encode it.

The Overload Pattern Encoder supports:

* Setting primary input and primary output
* Setting byproducts
* An **Ignore NBT** switch: when enabled, item matching ignores NBT data

## Automation Tips

* In large automated crafting systems, Wireless Mode can dramatically reduce pipe complexity
* Combined with the Balanced Distribution strategy and multiple processing machines, you get parallel crafting for free
* Enable the Fast speed tier for better responsiveness
* Pick the return mode that matches the specific automation scenario
