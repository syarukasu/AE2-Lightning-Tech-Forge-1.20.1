The Wireless Network system lets you extend your Overloaded ME network across long distances — or even across dimensions — without running cables. A **Wireless Overloaded Controller** broadcasts on a frequency, and one or more **Wireless Receivers** tune in to create a virtual grid connection.

## Components

### Wireless Overloaded Controller

</Row>

The **Wireless Overloaded Controller** is an [Overloaded ME Controller](overloaded-controller.md) that doubles as a wireless transmitter. It broadcasts its grid node on a selected frequency so that remote Wireless Receivers can connect to it.

* Supplies the same extra channels and energy as a regular Overloaded Controller
* One Wireless or Advanced Wireless Overloaded Controller is enough for the whole Overloaded Controller multiblock; the other controller blocks can stay regular Overloaded ME Controllers
* Each controller can only broadcast on **one frequency** at a time
* A frequency can only be occupied by one transmitter at a time
* Same-dimension only; each receiver link has a limited channel capacity (**32 channels** in the default AE2 channel mode)

### Advanced Wireless Overloaded Controller

</Row>

The **Advanced Wireless Overloaded Controller** is the upgraded variant with two key improvements:

* **Cross-dimension support**: Wireless Receivers in other dimensions can connect to it
* **Unlimited channel capacity**: removes the per-receiver channel limit entirely

### Wireless Receiver

</Row>

The **Wireless Receiver** is the counterpart that connects to a remote Wireless Overloaded Controller. Place it anywhere in the world, set it to the same frequency as the controller, and a virtual grid connection is established automatically.

* Consumes 5 AE/t idle power
* Can only connect to one frequency at a time
* Cross-dimension connections require an **Advanced** Wireless Overloaded Controller on the transmitter side

## Setting Up

1. Place or replace one block in the Overloaded Controller multiblock with a **Wireless Overloaded Controller**, then right-click it to open the frequency GUI
2. Select or create a frequency
3. Place a **Wireless Receiver** at the remote location and right-click it to open its frequency GUI
4. Select the same frequency — the receiver will automatically establish a virtual connection to the controller's grid

Once connected, the receiver acts as if it were physically cabled to the controller. Devices attached to the receiver's local network gain access to the controller's ME network, including channels, storage, and crafting.

## Frequency Security

Frequencies support access control:

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Public | Anyone can bind a receiver to this frequency |
| Private | Only the frequency owner and allowed members can bind |
| Encrypted | Requires a password to bind |

Unbound controllers and receivers are always accessible regardless of security level.

## Tips

* Use the Advanced variant when you need to bridge networks across dimensions
* Use the Advanced variant when one receiver must serve more channels than the ordinary wireless link allows
* A single controller can serve many receivers — each receiver creates its own virtual connection
* You do not need to replace every block in the multiblock with a wireless variant; add more wireless controllers only when you intentionally want extra independent transmitter frequencies
