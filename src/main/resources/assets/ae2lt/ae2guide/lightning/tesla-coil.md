# Tesla Coil

The **Tesla Coil** is the core device for controlled, stable Lightning production. It does not depend on the weather — it produces Lightning on demand by consuming FE and materials.

## Two Operating Modes

The Tesla Coil GUI lets you switch between two modes.

### High Voltage Mode

* **Input**: Overload Crystal Dust + FE
* **Output**: High Voltage Lightning (injected into the ME network)
* **Default cost**: 2 Overload Crystal Dust + 25,000 FE per 1 HV Lightning produced

High Voltage mode supports batch processing. The coil locks in the full amount of available crystal dust in its input slot and the HV Lightning headroom left in the ME network, then produces that entire batch in one charge cycle.

### Extreme High Voltage Mode

* **Input**: High Voltage Lightning (pulled from the ME network) + FE, and a **Lightning Collapse Matrix** must be installed
* **Output**: Extreme High Voltage Lightning (injected into the ME network)
* **Default cost**: 8 HV Lightning + 500,000 FE per 1 EHV Lightning produced
* Each charge cycle produces exactly 1 EHV Lightning. The matrix is not consumed.

## Operating Flow

1. Select a mode from the GUI
2. Prepare materials — HV mode: put Overload Crystal Dust into the slot; EHV mode: verify the matrix is installed and the network has enough HV Lightning
3. Supply FE (the coil has a 16,000,000 FE internal buffer and accepts up to 200,000 FE/tick)
4. The coil locks in the mode and starts charging (about 5 ticks)
5. When the charge completes, the output is injected into the ME network in one batch

## GUI Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Idle | Mode not locked in, waiting for inputs or the network to become ready |
| Charging | Consuming FE |
| Waiting for FE | FE is insufficient for the current tick's consumption |
| Waiting for inputs | Missing crystal dust / matrix / HV Lightning |
| Waiting for ME network | The network cannot accept the output, or does not have enough HV Lightning to consume |
| Ready to commit | Charge complete; the output commits next tick |

## Lightning Collapse Matrix

<ItemImage id="ae2lt:lightning_collapse_matrix" scale="2" float="left" />

Extreme High Voltage mode requires a **Lightning Collapse Matrix** in the coil's matrix slot. The matrix is **not consumed** during processing, but it must stay in the slot.
