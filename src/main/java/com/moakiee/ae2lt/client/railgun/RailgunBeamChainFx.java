/**
 * Client-side dispatcher for the left-beam chain-jump visual. Mirrors what
 * {@link RailgunClientFx} does for charged shots, but scaled-down for the
 * continuous-fire feel of the beam:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Real lightning arc segments along each chain pair via
 *       {@link RailgunArcRenderer#spawnChain}.</li>
 *   <li>A short electric-spark burst at every chained target so even glancing
 *       jumps read clearly.</li>
 *   <li>A subtle crackle sound at the first hit (positional) so the chain is
 *       audible as well as visible.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Lifetimes are intentionally shorter than the charged-shot chain (~16 ticks)
 * because the beam re-fires the chain up to 4×/sec — long-lived arcs would
 * stack and wash out the screen.
